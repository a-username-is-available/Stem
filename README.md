# YumBox Release v1.0.0
Finally, its here.

## Tutorial
At the top of the screen you can see your statistics, the version, as well as some buttons. One of the is the shop, and the other is the inventory. Clicking on one of them either opens or closes a menu.

You start off with 10 coins

### Shop
The shops is where you buy things (duh). As a new player, you can only buy some grass, (and also the items in the shop are literally called 'things', check the code if you want). When you click on buy, it puts the bought item into your inventory.

### Inventory
In the inventory, just click on something to place it down on the green thingy. Click the inventory icon again to see you placed 'thing'.

### 'Things'
Every 'thing' gives you a set amount of coins per minute, clicking on one of them brings up a menu. The stuff on the menu is pretty obvious what the buttons on it do.
